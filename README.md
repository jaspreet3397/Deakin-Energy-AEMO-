# DeakinEnergy
Project I did under SIT764

Steps to get started with the Deakin Energy Application

Clone the repository using the link

Open cmd and browse to the root directory.

In your cmd, type "install" + Enter { This would run the bat file to create the virtual environment and activate it }

Run " pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all the essential packages required to run the application.

After the installation of the requirements, use the command "python main.py" to run the project.
